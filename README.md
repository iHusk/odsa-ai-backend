# AI-2: AI Backend Engineering

Build AI-powered pipelines in Python. Extract structure from unstructured inputs, work with embeddings and vector databases, and implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to improve model output.

## First-Time Setup

1. **Clone this repo** using GitHub Desktop (URL provided in class)
2. **Open the folder** in VS Code (`File` → `Open Folder` → select `odsa-ai-backend`)
3. **Open the setup notebook:** `notebooks/session_0_1_setup.ipynb`
4. **Follow it step by step** — it will install everything and verify your environment

The setup notebook walks you through installing `uv`, Python, dependencies, selecting your kernel, and creating your workspace. Every step has a verification check — all should show **PASS** before you move on.

## Before Each Class

```
1. Open GitHub Desktop → Fetch origin → Pull
2. Copy the new session notebook from notebooks/ into my_work/
3. Open the copy from my_work/ and work there
```

**Why `my_work/`?** This folder is git-ignored. When the instructor pushes updates, `git pull` updates the master copies in `notebooks/` without touching your work. No merge conflicts, no lost progress.

## Grading

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Lab 1 — Batch Extraction | 20% |
| Lab 2 — RAG Evaluation | 20% |
| Written Exam | 50% |
| Participation | 10% |
| **Passing** | **70% or above** |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| `uv` not found | Close and reopen your terminal after installing uv |
| Kernel not listed in VS Code | `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Reload Window", then reselect kernel |
| "Module not found" error | Make sure your kernel is set to `.venv`, not system Python |
| `AuthenticationError` | Check `.env` is in the project root and key starts with `sk-ant-` |
| Packages missing after `uv sync` | Reload VS Code window, then re-run the package check cell |
| Cells error after reloading VS Code | Normal — reload clears variables. Run cells from the top again |
| `git pull` has conflicts | You may have edited a file in `notebooks/`. Work in `my_work/` instead |

## Need Help?

- Re-run `notebooks/session_0_1_setup.ipynb` to diagnose environment issues
- Check the troubleshooting table above
- Ask in class or during office hours
